        During the second half of the Founders & Coders course, we built two
        projects, one of which was for an external client. Both were designed,
        user tested and delivered over the course of three week long sprints.

        Every week we build a small, one page project that demonstrates our
        understanding of the topic we have been focusing on that week. Each
        project is built by a team of four students, and we spend a day and a
        half building, and another half a day code reviewing other teams, fixing
        bugs and issues, and presenting our work to the rest of the students.
